Shot on Dec 22, 2024\n\n\nNo joking, writing killer apology letters was the most valuable skill I picked up during my PhD, courtesy of our amazing faculty.\nI got so good at it that I’m thinking of sharing my collection from just the first semester (talk about a learning curve). Think of it as my contribution to future PhD students. So if you ever find yourself in a similar bind, feel free to borrow from my templates or get Claude to whip one up for you.\nWhenever you’re stressing about writing that next apology email, just remember: there’s a whole community of us out there who’ve been in your shoes. You’re definitely not alone in this!\nWish you luck!\n\nSorry for Being a Solo Hero\n\nTotally get now that group work was meant to teach collaboration skills, not just finish the nonsense project.\n\nThe Remote Access Oops\n\nSaving the admin password on the root directory was the worst practice for any trained IT guys. But super poor judgment on my part as well. I determine to unplug the power cord for monitor and use RDP next time.\nHowever I still love the username for the account I created, that’s the killer part of the whole story!"
