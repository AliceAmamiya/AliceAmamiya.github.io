At the very least, unlike my buddies, I do my makeup and wear proper clothes instead of grid sleeves and pajamas,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand here it is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lalafellin in real life.\n\n\n\n\n\nI will get back later to provide detailed information about my work. For now, this has worked well."
