Questions and solutions included.\nAlthough I learned most of the material covered in the lecture decades ago while preparing for the SAT statistics, and I’m not really an SPSS person, the lab work in EDUC8009 has been the most efficient way for me to relieve weekly stress. It may sound strange, but I genuinely enjoy working with datasets that require no further preprocessing.\nI appreciate both the assignments and the instructor. Along with the delightful outfits I wear after Wednesday every week, they have made my tough weeks more manageable.\n\n\n\n\nLyhe-Mheg Forever. #XMWDXM #FFXIV"
